	<h1>Time, Space and Algorithm Complexity</h1>

<p>
  Time complexity explains how the running time of an algorithm grows as input increases. 
  Understanding Time complexity helps us choose more efficient algorithms.

<p>
  <b>Space Complexity</b> describes how much extra memory an algorithm needs, and it is often written using notations like O(n).
